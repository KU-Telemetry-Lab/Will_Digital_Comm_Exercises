    "The following outlines the symbol clock synchronizer (SCS) subsystem used in communications systems with non-coherent transmitter and receiver architectures. This highlights the various submodules needed to correct clock offsets and explains their internal functionalities. While a phase-locked loop (PLL) can track the envelope, the analog-to-digital converter produces a sampled version of the received signal that has no coherence with the ideal symbol times. The SCS addresses the small clock offsets needed to be made in order to sample at the optimal rate allowing for synchronization to be reintroduced between the transmitter and receiver. Figure 1 below displays the different SCS submodules and their placement in the overall system.\n",

    "The loop filter module provides stability for the overall SCS sstem by shaping the transient response of the system as well as adjusting the gain applied to the proportional timing error detector output. During instantiation of the SCS system, a loop bandwidth and damping factor are defined as parameters shaping this transient response in which the loop bandwidth specifies the speed at which the SCS will converge towards zeroing the received symbol clock offset. Setting a wider loop bandwidth allows the SCS to respond more rapidly respond to different clock offsets but introduces more internal noise. The damping factor specifies how the oscillations decay in the transient response when a input frequency change is introduced. Together these parameters categorize the loop filter coefficients $K_1$ and $K_2$. *The gain of the system adjusts the output of the loopfilter and represents the step size to be made when adjusting the interpolator via the calculated timing offset. This parameter is set via running the timing error detector and loop filter in a open loop test in which the largest output is then used as the gain to normalize the loop filter output to one.*\n",
