A fundamental understanding of QAM and other signal modulation standards is assumed and will be only briefly reviewed before model development is discussed. Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) is a method that combines amplitude modulation (AM) and phase modulation (PM) to encode data into a signal. It achieves this by varying the amplitude of two carrier waves, which are 90 degrees out of phase with each other. This allows QAM to represent multiple bits of information per symbol, increasing data transmission rates. Common variations of QAM, such as 16-QAM and 64-QAM, use different combinations of amplitude and phase shifts to transmit 4 and 6 bits per symbol, respectively. The robustness of QAM makes it widely used in modern communication systems, including digital television and broadband internet. However, its susceptibility to noise and interference requires careful implementation and signal processing techniques to maintain signal integrity and optimize performance.
