    "\n",
    "The following quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) system illustrates the core elements of a digital communication system, featuring simplified receiver and transmitter components that are fully synchronized. These core elements are divided into submodules, including bit-to-symbol mapping, upsampling and downsampling of the baseband signal, pulse shaping, and carrier frequency modulation. Each of these modules are summarized in Figure 1 and will be discussed separately below to showcase the functionality of the developed signal processing library and their performance objectives.\n",

    "#### Upsample the Baseband Signal\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in the transmitter's sequential path is to upsample the test input symbols by the previously defined upsample rate. Upsampling increases the sampling rate of the signal, allowing for finer resolution in the representation of the symbols. This is particularly important in digital communication systems to ensure that the signal can be accurately processed and transmitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "The upsampling process can be mathematically represented as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x\\left(nT_s\\right) \\rightarrow x_{upsampled}\\left(\\frac{nT_s}{N}\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",

    "- \\( N \\) is the upsample rate,\n",
    "- \\( T_s \\) is the sample duration, \n",
    "- \\( n \\) is the sample index.\n",
    "\n",
    "During this process, the baseband signal will be split into its real and imaginary components. For demonstration purposes, these components will be visualized as two separate wires. This separation allows for a clearer understanding of how the signal behaves in both the real and imaginary domains, which is crucial for effective modulation and transmission in the later stages of the communication system. By upsampling and visualizing the components, we ensure that the subsequent signal processing steps can be executed with higher fidelity and accuracy.\n"
